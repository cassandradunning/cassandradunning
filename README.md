## ✨ About Me
Hi I'm Cassie! I'm a software developer based in Nashville, Tennessee.

I first fell in love with web design on my middle school blog. Throughout the years, that looked like volunteering to manage and maintain the website of any company I could get my hands on. 



👩‍💻 I just finished an apprenticeship at [Nashville Software School](https://nashvillesoftwareschool.com/)

🧠 I'm currently learning: How to deploy my projects - any tips?!
